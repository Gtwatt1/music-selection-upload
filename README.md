## A simple code snippet that handles handles what happens when the music library is opened

#### The app starts out with a simple button with a text label that says "Select Music". When this button is clicked, the phone's music library is opened, and ready for the user to select a song to play. When a song is selected, the song begins to play and then details about the song selected(more specifically: song title and song cover art) are displayed on the screen immediately the music library is dismissed.
