## A simple code snippet that handles selecting a song from the phone music library, playing and stopping the song and also uploading the selected song to firebase for storage

### The app starts out with a button with a text label that says "Select Music". When this button is clicked, the phone's music library is opened, and ready for the user to select a song. When a song is selected, the music library is dismissed and details about the song (more specifically: song title and song cover art) are displayed on the screen . 

### - The play button plays the selected song.
### - The stop button stops the music player altogether.
### - The upload button, once clicked, uploads the selected song to firebase and then an alert pops up to show confimation of a successful or failed upload as the case may be.
